    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Marinade</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>28 oz (800g) boneless and skinless chicken thighs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger (or finely grated)</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Curry</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp (30 g) ghee or butter, OR 1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato passata (aka tomato puree)</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy / thickened cream</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the Marinade ingredients with the chicken in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours (minimum 3 hrs).</li>
        <li>Cook chicken: Heat the ghee (butter or oil) over high heat in a large fry pan. Take the chicken out of the Marinade but do not wipe or shake off the marinade from the chicken (but don't pour the Marinade left in the bowl into the fry pan).</li> 
        <li>Place chicken in the fry pan and cook for around 3 minutes, or until the chicken is white all over (it doesn't really brown because of the Marinade).</li>
        <li>Sauce: Add the tomato passata, cream, sugar and salt. Also add any remaining marinade left in the bowl. Turn down to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Do a taste test to see if it needs more salt.</li>
        <li>Garnish with coriander/cilantro leaves if using. Serve with basmati rice.</li>
